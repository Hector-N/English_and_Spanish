## Concept

## Syntax:

## Examples

I used to play tennis every Saturday (but I don't play these days).  
We used to live in Tbilisi (and we live in Kiev now).  


## Question form

Did your dad use to smoke 40 cigarettes a day when he was a heave smoker?  


## Negation form: 2 ways

1. **did not**: I didn't use to like him (but I like him now).
2. **used not**: I used not to like him.


## Nuance

If you want to emphasize presence of something or someone in particular place, 
start sentence with **there is/are**.  
Construct **used + to-V** also may be used with **there is/are**.  
The last one is not translated into English.  
**Example:**  
There are chairs in the room.  
There is a dictionary and 2 new English books on the shelf.  

As long as **there is/are** has no independent meaning,  
to express such circumstance of place as **there** - use it additionally in the end of sentence.  
**Example:**  
There were a lot of dogs there.
Is there a dictionary on the shelf? **(question form formed by rearranging)**  
There isn't a dictionary on the shelf.  

As any other construct with **to be**, construct **there is/are** can change in times.  
**Example:**  
There were many good days last month.  
There used to be a cinema in the town.  
There used to be 5 cinemas in the town but there is only one now.
