# V For Vendetta

-- Don't touch me!  
-- Look, willie, kitty's got **claws**.

I don't think so.  **I should be getting home**.  

-- Tell me, do you know **what day it is**, Evey?  
-- **November the 4th**?  
-- Not **anymore** (~~any more~~).

-- Remember, remember. The fifth of November

The gunpowder treason and plot.  

Our **surveillance cameras** captured several images of the **terrorist**...   
...though the mask obviously makes retinal identification impossible.  
We also managed to get a picture of the girl.  

Don't piss me about. You show me ID, or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.  

**Will** all personnel please evacuate the building.  
**This is not a drill**.  

It's jammed. Break it down.  

There are, **of course**, those who do not want us to speak.  

Let me think, let me think.  

-- God, what have I done? 
I **maced** that detective.  
Why did I do that?  
-- You did what you thought was right.  
-- No, I shouldn't have done that.  
-- Is that really what you think, or what they'd want you to think?  

-- I have friends, I could stay with them.  
-- I'm **afraid** that won't work either.

-- She died in a hunger strike. He died when the military retook the **shed**.  

-- I just wanted to **apologize** for my reaction last night.  
Your hands!  
-- There, that's better.  
I hope I didn't put you off your **appetite**.  

-- God, I **haven't had** real butter since I was a little girl.  
Where did you get it?  
-- A government **supply train** on its way to Chancellor Sutler.  
-- You **stole** this from Chancellor Sutler?  
-- Yes.  

Good guys **win**, bad guys **lose**... and, as always, **England prevails**!  

You **wore** a uniform **those days**.  

-- Would you like to?  
-- Does it have a happy ending?  
-- As only **celluloid (?)** can deliver.
-- Put the **sword** away.  
-- Did you like it?  
-- Yeah. But it made me **feel sorry for** Mercedes.  
-- Why?  
-- Because he cared more about **revenge** **than** he did about her.  

-- She **blinks a lot** when she **does a story** she knows is false.  
-- I **might have killed** the Fingermen that **attacked** you. **I heard no objection**.  
**Violence** can be used for good.  

-- **I've been thinking**... There's something I want to ask you.  

-- Do you really think you'll find something here?  
-- **Worth a shot**.  
-- One thing is true **of** all governments: **The most reliable records are tax records**.  

-- **It appears that** the original electronic records **have all been lost**.  
**But I found** this hard copy filed in the cold vault.  

-- **May 23rd**  

-- Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?  

-- There are 872 songs in here.  
**I've listened to them all**, but I've **never danced to** any of them.  
-- Did you hear me?  
-- Yes  
-- I can't stay here.  
-- I have a **gift** for you, Evey...  
But before I give it to you, I'd like to ask you something.  
Would you dance with me?  
-- Now? On the **eve** of your revolution?  
-- A revolution without dancing is a revolution **not worth having**.  
-- I'd love to.  

-- You could let it go. **We could leave** ~~live~~ here together.  
-- No. **You were right about** what I am.  
**I have no tree waiting for me**.  

Agent: Where is he?  
V: **Penny for the Guy**. 
**I have kept my side** of the **bargain**, but **have you kept yours**?  
Agent: Bring him down.  

Agent: Now that's done with... it's time to have a look at your face. Take off your mask.  

Agent: You won't cry like him, will you?  
You're **not afraid** (~~affraid~~) of death.  
You're like me.  
V: The only thing you and I have in common, Mr. Creedy.... is we're both **about to die**.  
Agent: How do you imagine that's gonna happen?  
V: With my hand around your neck.  

X: Who was he?  
E: He was Edmond Dantes.  
And he was my father...  
... and my mother.  
My brother.  
My friend.  
He was you...  
... and my.  
He was all of us.  

E: No one **will ever forget** that night... and **what it meant** for this country.  
But **I will never forget** the man... and **what he meant to me**.  

-- SALUTE!
